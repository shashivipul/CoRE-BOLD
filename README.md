# CoRE-BOLD
This repository will contain the source code of our paper "CoRE-BOLD: Cross-Domain Robust and Equitable Ensemble for BOLD Signal Analysis". This is the first framework to introduce an ensemble network to handle both time and frequency domain extracted functional connectivity of brain. Furthermore, the proposed framwork provides a unified solution to robustness and fairness issues associated in medical imaging. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and trustworthiness parameterizes by SER and Unfairness metric.
